#SQL tables and views used for Synergetic - Canvas SIS integrations

 
This is a collection of table and view creation scripts designed for a Synergetic database.  Akll tables and views are created as user tables and user views, as per Synergetic requirements.

The tables allow you to set Master Course codes, sub accounts, groups, terms and user permissions overrides.

The views integrate with Synergetic views and tables to match up courses with the Master Course tables and allow the Powershell SIS sctipt to call them for CSV export.
